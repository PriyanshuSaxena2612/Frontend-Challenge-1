## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is my first challenge and I have learnt many things. I have learnt how to use flexbox within the divs properly, and which properties of flex box to use at what time. Moreover arranging the items was a difficult thing for me, so I learnt that also.

Some of the mentions of my code to which I am happy I did myselves:

```html
<div class="annual-plan">
            <div class="content-padding">
              <img src="./images/icon-music.svg" alt="" class="ðŸŽµ" />
              <div class="content-2">
                <p class="ðŸ’ª">Annual Plan</p>
                <p>$59.99/year</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="change"><a href="#">Change</a></div>
          </div>
```
```css
.change {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: flex-start;
    width: 5rem;
}
```
